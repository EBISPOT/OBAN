### What is OBAN
OBAN stands for **O**pen **B**iomedical **AN**notations. It is an ontology model used to describe associations between biomedical entities in triple format based on W3C specification. OBAN is a generic association representation model that loosely couples a subject and object (e.g. disease and phenotype) via a construction of class *OBAN:association*. The association is supported by an evidence of class *OBAN:provenance* where a tracable record for that association assertion is described.
